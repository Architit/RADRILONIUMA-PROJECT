# WORKFLOW SNAPSHOT (STATE)

## Identity
repo: RADRILONIUMA-PROJECT
branch: main
timestamp: 2026-02-13T02:12:14Z

## Current pointer
phase: Phase 5.B — Ecosystem Coverage Expansion — ACTIVE
stage: postreview sync with LAM P3.2/P3.3 completed
step: governance coherence refresh after LAM phase-3 hardening
protocol_scale: +1
protocol_scale_reason: User-directed governance execution context remains active for ecosystem coherence.
protocol_semantic_en: positive
goal:
- Maintain governance coherence between RADRILONIUMA and LAM
- Keep Phase 5.B facts synchronized
- Capture LAM phase-3 governance hardening in SoT notes
constraints:
- contracts-first
- observability-first
- derivation-only
- NO runtime logic
- NO execution-path impact
- NO enforcement/automation
- clean working tree required before phase close

## Declared (planning)

- Phase 5.A — Repo Rollout Analysis [DONE]
- Phase 5.B — Ecosystem Coverage Expansion [ACTIVE]
- Development Stage: Phase 5.B Execution — Ecosystem Coverage Expansion
