# WORKFLOW SNAPSHOT (STATE)

## Identity
repo: RADRILONIUMA-PROJECT
branch: main
timestamp: 2026-02-11T23:42:23Z

## Current pointer
phase: Governance Review & Ecosystem Cartography Stage — ACTIVE
goal:
- Preserve and synchronize governance context after Phase 4 close
- Map and define Phase 5 (Rollout & Ecosystem Observability) without execution
- Ensure ecosystem-wide observability before any execution-phase starts
constraints:
- contracts-first
- observability-first
- derivation-only
- NO runtime logic
- NO execution-path impact
- NO enforcement/automation
- clean working tree required before phase close

## Declared (planning)
- Phase 5 — Rollout & Ecosystem Observability Layer [DECLARED]
- Phase 5.A — Repo Rollout Analysis [PLANNED]
- Development Stage: Governance Review & Ecosystem Cartography (mandatory)

## Completed
- Phase 3.1.C — Task Spec Layer [DONE]
- Phase 3.2 — Ecosystem Structural Layer [DONE]
- Phase 4.A — DevKit Subtree Distribution [DONE]
- Phase 4.B — Workflow Snapshot Export/Import [DONE]
- Phase 4.C — Cross-repo Governance Rules [DONE]
