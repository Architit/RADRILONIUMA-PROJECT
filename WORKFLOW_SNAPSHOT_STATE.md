# WORKFLOW SNAPSHOT (STATE)

## Identity
repo: RADRILONIUMA-PROJECT
branch: main
timestamp: 2026-02-13T01:06:06Z

## Current pointer
phase: Phase 5.B — Ecosystem Coverage Expansion — ACTIVE
stage: Phase 5.B Execution — Ecosystem Coverage Expansion
step: postreview sync with LAM R6.1 host-split success
protocol_scale: +1
protocol_scale_reason: User-directed governance execution context remains active for ecosystem coverage/support.
protocol_semantic_en: positive
goal:
- Maintain governance coherence between RADRILONIUMA and LAM
- Keep Phase 5.B facts synchronized
- Support LAM transition from R6.1 to R6.2
constraints:
- contracts-first
- observability-first
- derivation-only
- NO runtime logic
- NO execution-path impact
- NO enforcement/automation
- clean working tree required before phase close

## Declared (planning)

- Phase 5.A — Repo Rollout Analysis [DONE]
- Phase 5.B — Ecosystem Coverage Expansion [ACTIVE]

## New Chat Init

### NEW_CHAT_INIT_MESSAGE
ssn rstrt

Repository: RADRILONIUMA-PROJECT
Branch: main
Phase: Phase 5.B — Ecosystem Coverage Expansion — ACTIVE
Stage: Phase 5.B Execution — Ecosystem Coverage Expansion
Protocol scale: +1
Protocol semantic (en): positive
Constraints:
- contracts-first
- observability-first
- derivation-only

If NEW chat and governance handoff gate is satisfied: Proceed with Phase 2 (IMPORT).
If handoff gate is not satisfied: return to active chat and complete governance handoff first.
