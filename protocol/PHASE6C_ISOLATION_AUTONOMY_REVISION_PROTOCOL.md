# PHASE 6.C ISOLATION AUTONOMY REVISION PROTOCOL

timestamp_utc: 2026-02-13T10:21:35Z
scope: internal ecosystems, spaces, environments
mode: full isolation + full autonomy + deep revision

## Objective
- Enforce complete isolation of internal ecosystems/spaces/environments.
- Activate autonomous operation baseline (no external dependency for governance cycle execution).
- Run deep detailed revision across:
  - genetic/code layer,
  - ecosystem/system layer,
  - organism/architecture layer.

## Mandatory Sequence
1) Isolation activation:
   - close unauthorized gates/channels/flows,
   - freeze cross-space mutation,
   - lock deterministic governance boundary.
2) Autonomous mode activation:
   - local-only governance cycle,
   - policy/state artifacts as primary execution map.
3) Deep revision:
   - past/present/future analytical triad,
   - full protocol coherence and risk map,
   - integrity and drift matrix.
4) Re-initiation:
   - repeat zeroization + creation cycle of previous phase artifacts as baseline regeneration,
   - preserve historical evidence in archive space.

## Entry Gate
- `VERSION_GATE_RESET_PROTOCOL.md` pre-gate requirements must be satisfied.
- Drift Gate v1 and ESSR/ESR heartbeat checkpoints must be fresh.

## Exit Gate
- isolation status: `ACTIVE`
- autonomy status: `ACTIVE`
- revision status: `COMPLETE`
- compliance gate: `COMPLIANT`
- ASR evidence linked in index/maps/logs.

## Constraints
- contracts-first
- observability-first
- derivation-only
- no runtime logic changes
