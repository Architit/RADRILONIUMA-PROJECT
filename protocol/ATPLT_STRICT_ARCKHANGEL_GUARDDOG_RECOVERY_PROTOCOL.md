# ATPLT STRICT ARCKHANGEL GUARDDOG RECOVERY PROTOCOL

protocol_type: strict_recovery_governance_contract
scope: atplt strict mode for guarddog-driven recovery lifecycle
mode: contracts-first, observability-first, derivation-only

## Canonical Strict Chain
`recovery -> reboot -> restart -> resync -> recycle -> reheal -> repulse -> rebit -> rebreath -> restream -> reflow -> repush -> rebite -> repunch -> remove -> rezoom -> rescope -> redo -> repatch -> retouch`

## Guarddog Controls
- watchdog must remain `GREEN`; otherwise escalate per cadence contract.
- no cycle increment when closure gate is OPEN.
- strict evidence registration is mandatory at each wave.

## Burst Rule
- signal `+ + +` applies deterministic increment `+3` only when phase state is ACTIVE and closure gate is CLOSED.

## Evidence and Sync
- record ASR for each strict wave
- synchronize:
  - `DEV_LOGS.md`
  - `ROADMAP.md`
  - `GOV_STATUS.md`
  - `WORKFLOW_SNAPSHOT_STATE.md`
  - `TASK_MAP.md`
  - `gov/asr/INDEX.md`

## Compatibility
Policy-only. No runtime logic. No execution-path impact.
