status: governance narrative report

## Core Thesis
RADRILONIUMA is treated as a Living Artificial Structure with strict governance boundaries. The system combines semantic identity layers, deterministic patch workflows, and distributed storage topology to keep autonomous evolution observable and controllable.

## Engineering Invariants
- contracts-first
- observability-first
- derivation-only
- no runtime logic mutation
- no execution-path impact from governance artifacts

## Distributed Memory Topology (Narrative Model)
- GitHub: canonical procedural memory and source-of-truth governance.
- OneDrive: transactional bridge between Windows/WSL and cloud-facing workspaces.
- Google Drive: episodic/context lake for asynchronous semantic payloads.

## DevKit Control Plane
- canonical patch execution via `devkit/patch.sh`.
- deterministic cycle: context sync -> action block -> safety check -> verification -> governance update.
- cold-restart continuity is mandatory through snapshot artifacts and protocol gates.

## Semantic Identity Framework
The system uses multi-layer naming (true name, public call sign, system ID) as a control and routing mechanism for autonomous modules. This improves namespace isolation and reduces semantic drift in agent execution contexts.

## Strategic Expansion Direction
The active trajectory emphasizes:
- growth and evolution under policy constraints,
- activation/initiation of new governance contracts,
- upgrading and refactoring without runtime-path disruption,
- production/logistics/transport coordination through protocolized checkpoints,
- restore/restart/reheal loops with ASR traceability.

## Governance Use
This report is a strategic architecture reference and not a runtime specification. All operational transitions must be protocol-bound and ASR-registered.
