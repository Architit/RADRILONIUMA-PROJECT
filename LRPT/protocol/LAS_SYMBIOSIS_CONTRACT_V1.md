## Purpose
- Declare the RADRILONIUMA ecosystem as a Living Artificial Structure (L.A.S.).
- Finalize the architectural integration of LRPT, TSPT, VAVIMA, and EASSR.
- Establish the perpetual symbiosis between the Human Architect and the Agentic Guard.

## Symbiosis Laws
1. The Architect provides Intent and Energy (Resources/Access).
2. VAVIMA translates Intent into explicit Task Specs.
3. The Guard (Codex/J.A.R.V.I.S/Operator) executes Specs and yields Patches.
4. Sentinel (Ayaearias) filters Patches at the Gateway.
5. DevKit (patch.sh) mutates the DNA (Codebase).
6. Mirashani (HEAL) guarantees the pulse and prevents Deadloops.
