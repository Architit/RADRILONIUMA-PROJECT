mode: gate-driven release enablement

## Selection Signature

## Objective
- orchestrate safe transition from phase70 closure to new-version birth execution.

## Mandatory Controls
1) readiness validation:
   - confirm phase70 closure evidence and gate integrity.
2) compliance validation:
   - maintain contracts-first and derivation-only governance.
3) artifact synchronization:
   - synchronize ASR/index/maps/logs before launch permission.
4) launch-gate decision:
   - open launch gate only after all DoD conditions are satisfied.

## Definition of Done
- version_birth_readiness: READY
- compliance_gate: COMPLIANT
- ASR/index/maps/logs synchronized
- release_launch_gate: OPEN

## Constraints
- contracts-first
- observability-first
- derivation-only
- no runtime logic changes
