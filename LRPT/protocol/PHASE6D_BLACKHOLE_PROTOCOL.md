# PHASE 6.D BLACKHOLE PROTOCOL

timestamp_utc: 2026-02-13T10:35:09Z
scope: phase blackhole activation/initiation
mode: containment + null-drift sink + controlled re-emergence

## Activation Signature (verbatim)
p 6 d\=\4\в\=\...<<<...} protocol blackhole активация инициация фазы { < ... < - < ... < = < ... < 0 < ... < = < ... < + < ... < = < ... < 1 < ... <    = < ... < - < ... < = < ... < 1 < ... < = < ... < 0 < ... < = < ... < + < ... < }

## Phase Vector (normalized)
- `{ -=0=+=1=-=1=0=+ }`
- intent: collapse unresolved drift into a deterministic governance sink, then restart with validated baseline.

## Mandatory Sequence
1) blackhole activation:
   - route unresolved protocol tails into isolated containment context,
   - deny uncontrolled propagation into active execution waves.
2) initiation gate:
   - require fresh drift gate + heartbeat evidence,
   - require compliance state from Phase 6.C and pre-gate contracts.
3) sink reconciliation:
   - classify residuals (drift/recovery/history anomalies),
   - map each residual to closure action and evidence artifact.
4) controlled re-emergence:
   - permit next subphase only after sink state is `STABLE`.

## Gate States
- `ACTIVE`: blackhole protocol enabled.
- `SINKING`: residuals are being reconciled.
- `STABLE`: no unresolved residual tails; transition allowed.
- `BLOCKED`: unresolved high-risk residuals remain.

## Dependencies
- `VERSION_GATE_RESET_PROTOCOL.md`
- `PHASE6C_ISOLATION_AUTONOMY_REVISION_PROTOCOL.md`

## Constraints
- contracts-first
- observability-first
- derivation-only
- no runtime logic changes
