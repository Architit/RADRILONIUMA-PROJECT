# RADRILONIUMA GROWTH EVOLUTION ACTIVATION PROTOCOL

timestamp_utc: 2026-02-16T00:17:11Z
scope: orchestrated governance lifecycle for growth/evolution and operational expansion
mode: contracts-first, observability-first, non-runtime governance

## Objective
- Formalize multi-vector lifecycle progression:
  growth, evolution, activation, initiation, upgrading, development, research, science, production, logistics, transport, scanning, reviewing, restoring, restarting, rehealing, refactoring.
- Keep all progression evidence-linked and deterministic.

## Lifecycle Chain
1) `growth_plan_lock`
2) `evolution_scope_map`
3) `activation_initiation_gate`
4) `upgrade_development_review`
5) `research_science_validation`
6) `production_logistics_transport_sync`
7) `scanning_reviewing_checkpoint`
8) `restore_restart_reheal_cycle`
9) `refactor_stability_gate`
10) `asr_closure_register`

## Hard Rules
- no stage transition without prior stage evidence.
- unresolved verification or drift => `BLOCKED`.
- runtime codepath mutation is out of scope for this protocol.

## Dependencies
- `INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md`
- `GOV_STATUS.md`
- `ROADMAP.md`
- `DEV_LOGS.md`
- `WORKFLOW_SNAPSHOT_STATE.md`
- `gov/asr/INDEX.md`

## Exit Criteria
- lifecycle_chain_state: `COMPLETE`
- governance_state: `ALIGNED`
- evidence_state: `REGISTERED`
