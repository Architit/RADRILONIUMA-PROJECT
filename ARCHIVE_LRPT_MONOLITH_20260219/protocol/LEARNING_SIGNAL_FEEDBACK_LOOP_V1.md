# LEARNING SIGNAL FEEDBACK LOOP V1

contract_type: learning_signal_feedback_loop
version: v1
status: ACTIVE
mode: contracts-first, derivation-only
effective_utc: 2026-02-17T03:33:37Z

## Purpose
- Convert observed failures into active synaptic constraints.
- Bind Council and A.E.G.I.S. decisions to static precondition memory.

## Loop Stages
1. Detect failure pattern.
2. Normalize into a signal entry.
3. Attach mitigation action and severity.
4. Activate signal in synaptic registry.
5. Require agents to reference active signals before generation.

## Constraints
- Signals are static artifacts only.
- No runtime learning daemon.
