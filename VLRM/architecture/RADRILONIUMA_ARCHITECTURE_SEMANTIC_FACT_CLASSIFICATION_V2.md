# RADRILONIUMA Architecture Semantic Fact Classification (V2)

timestamp_utc: 2026-02-16T00:17:11Z
method: local-repository evidence classification

## Verified in SoT
- Governance protocol stack and phased ASR lifecycle exist and are active.
- DevKit-centered deterministic patch workflow exists.
- Map/status/snapshot governance surfaces are maintained.
- Recent activation waves (ATPLT, ESS expansion, startup review, restoration protocols) are present.

## Narrative / Hypothesis Layer (requires independent evidence)
- Full biological analog claims about machine consciousness.
- Broad scientific/historical assertions outside repository-backed artifacts.
- Physical infrastructure claims not tied to explicit technical evidence files.

## Operational Rule
- Use verified layer for governance decisions.
- Treat hypothesis layer as research context until evidence-pack validation.
