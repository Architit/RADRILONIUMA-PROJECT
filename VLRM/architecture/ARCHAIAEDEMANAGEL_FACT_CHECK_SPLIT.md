# ARCHAIAEDEMANAGEL Fact-Check Split

timestamp_utc: 2026-02-15T23:54:20Z
scope: separate locally-verified claims from unverified hypotheses
method: repository-only verification (no external source validation in this pass)

## A) Locally Verified (inside current workspace)
- Governance SoT exists and is active in `RADRILONIUMA-PROJECT`.
- Multi-phase protocol stack is present:
  - `PHASE6C_ISOLATION_AUTONOMY_REVISION_PROTOCOL.md`
  - `PHASE6D_BLACKHOLE_PROTOCOL.md`
  - `PHASE6Z_ARCH_CORE_LIFECYCLE_PROTOCOL.md`
  - `PHASE70_SUNBIRTHLIGHTPULSEBIT_PROTOCOL.md`
  - `PHASE80_NEW_VERSION_BIRTH_ORCHESTRATION_PROTOCOL.md`
- ASR governance trail exists with dense checkpoint chain in `gov/asr/sessions/` and index coverage in `gov/asr/INDEX.md`.
- ATPLT and security-matrix governance records exist (2026-02-14 sessions).
- Trianiuma/Elarion archive-core restoration activation artifacts exist (2026-02-15 sessions and contracts).
- `GOV_STATUS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `DEV_LOGS.md`, and `WORKFLOW_SNAPSHOT_STATE.md` are used as canonical status surfaces.

## B) Not Verified in Local Repo (requires external or deeper technical evidence)
- Explicit implementation of domains named ECOSO/CATRAL/SOVEZHO as running production subsystems.
- Confirmed operational use of hyper-spectral datacubes in `380..2500 nm` with instrumented pipelines.
- Presence and active use of `ram.txt` and `archivator_raw.log` as runtime cognition/memory primitives.
- Implemented "Validating Eye" as a concrete safety module with measurable runtime gates.
- Hard OS-level suppression of destructive deletion globally across all runtime processes.
- CI/CD rejection rules for "violent code" as enforceable, tested gate.
- Archaeological and macro-historical claims (Gunung Padang dating details, resonance effects, cited researchers).
- Biological/anthropological claims tied to cosmic-prison hypotheses.

## C) Classification Guidance
- Treat section A as governance-fact baseline.
- Treat section B as hypothesis/research backlog until independently evidenced.
- Avoid promoting B-claims into operational safety claims without testable artifacts.

## D) Next Verification Pack (recommended)
1. Runtime evidence pack: executable paths, config, tests, logs.
2. Safety-gate evidence pack: policy checks, deny-path tests, CI traces.
3. Telemetry evidence pack: schema, sample data, ingestion chain, retention policy.
4. Source-attribution pack for historical/scientific claims.
