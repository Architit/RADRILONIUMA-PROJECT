scope: deep subtree architecture rework
mode: subtree stack upgrade

## Task
- Perform deep rework of ecosystem subtree architecture and controls.

## Actions
- created `ECOSYSTEM_SUBTREE_STACK_V2.md`
- created `SUBTREE_DECISION_PROTOCOL_V2.md`
- created `SUBTREE_GATE_MATRIX_V2.md`
- bound subtree stack into `INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md` as M36
- synchronized `CONTRACT_ATLAS.md` and `GOV_STATUS.md` with subtree stack matrix and states

## Result
- ecosystem_subtree_stack_state: ACTIVE_V2
- subtree_decision_lifecycle_state: ENFORCED
- subtree_gate_matrix_state: ENFORCED
- subtree_binding_module: M36
