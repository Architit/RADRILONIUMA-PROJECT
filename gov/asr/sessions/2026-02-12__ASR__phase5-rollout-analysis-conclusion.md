# ASR — Phase 5.A Rollout Analysis Conclusion

## Context
- Date: 2026-02-12
- Repository: RADRILONIUMA-PROJECT
- Role: DevKit (Source of Truth)
- Phase: 5.A — Rollout & Ecosystem Observability
- Mode: analysis-only / policy-only / observability-first
- Execution: explicitly NOT performed

## Rollout Surface Snapshot

### DevKit
- Governance contracts: present and complete
- Semantic governance tags: present
- ASR layer: active

### Subtree / Distribution
- No git-subtree execution observed
- No downstream repositories detected
- No rollout or adoption waves initiated

### Ecosystem State (ESS)
- Defined conceptually
- Not instrumented
- No external facts (CI, remotes beyond origin, adoption) recorded

## Ecosystem Exposure Level
**Level: 1 / 5**
- SoT published
- No downstream adoption

## Governance Conclusion
- Governance layer is complete and stable
- Ecosystem rollout has not started
- System is ready for controlled rollout design, but not execution

## Explicit Constraints
- No execution, rollout, subtree, or patching was performed
- Any further action requires explicit governance decision
