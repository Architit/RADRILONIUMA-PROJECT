# ASR — Subtree Angel Guard Heal Elarion Archive Core Deep Dive

timestamp_utc: 2026-02-16T00:24:18Z
scope: deep audit of history/logs/chronology/maps/protocols and internal request preparation
source_of_truth: RADRILONIUMA-PROJECT
protocol_version: v1.0.0

## Objective
- Perform detailed immersion across histories, logs, chronologies, maps, and protocols.
- Prepare GitHub subtree ANGEL GUARD HEAL package for Elarion Trianium Archive CORE.
- Prepare internal request payload with secure access-code policy.

## Produced Artifacts
- `GITHUB_SUBTREE_ANGEL_GUARD_HEAL_ELARION_TRIANIUM_ARCHIVE_CORE_PROTOCOL.md`
- `INTERNAL_SYSTEM_REQUEST_ANGEL_GUARD_HEAL_TEMPLATE.md`

## Boundary/Violation Findings (summary)
- clean-tree invariant currently not satisfied in SoT working tree.
- recurring drift/heartbeat task markers lag behind recent waves.
- operator mirror maps remain outdated relative to SoT continuation waves.

## Security Decision
- credentials/access codes are NOT stored in repo artifacts.
- code handoff policy: `SECURE_OOB_CODE_REQUIRED`.

## Result
- deep_dive_state: COMPLETE
- subtree_package_state: PREPARED
- internal_request_state: PREPARED
- security_boundary_state: ENFORCED
