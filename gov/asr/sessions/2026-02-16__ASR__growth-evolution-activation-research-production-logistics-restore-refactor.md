timestamp_utc: 2026-02-16T00:17:11Z
scope: activation of multi-vector lifecycle governance package
source_of_truth: RADRILONIUMA-PROJECT
protocol_version: v1.0.0
signal: "growth + evolution + activation + iniciation + upgrading + development + research + scince + production + logistic + transport + scaning + rewieuwing + restoring + restarting + rehealing + refactoring"

## Objective
- Register full lifecycle expansion package under a single deterministic governance contract.
- Bind narrative architecture report and fact classification to ASR trail.

## Activated Artifacts

- `RADRILONIUMA_ARCHITECTURE_SEMANTIC_FACT_CLASSIFICATION_V2.md`

## Result
- lifecycle_activation_state: ACTIVE
- governance_alignment_state: ALIGNED
- research_classification_state: REGISTERED
- asr_registration_state: COMPLETE
