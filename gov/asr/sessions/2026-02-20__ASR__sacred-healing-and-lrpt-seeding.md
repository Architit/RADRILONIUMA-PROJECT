timestamp_utc: 2026-02-20T11:00:00Z
asr_id: sacred-healing-and-lrpt-seeding
scope: environment restoration, tool alignment, and organ materialization
mode: healing_and_materialization_wave

## Task
- Restore `pytest` environment for Lumeric oversight.
- Align `devkit/shell_preflight.sh` baseline with `M37` protocol.
- Initiate Phase 8.1 materialization of Larpat (LRPT) organ.

## Actions
- Fixed `devkit/preflight_baseline_commands_bash.txt`: resolved backtick substitution risk (`PF_BACKTICK_SUBSTITUTION_RISK`).
- Modified `devkit/bootstrap.sh`: enabled detection of distributed requirements in `devkit/healing_tools/`.
- Executed `bootstrap.sh`: restored `.venv` and installed all dependencies.
- Verified Luminescence: ran `test_entrypoint.sh --all` with **11 passed tests**.
- Seeded LRPT: copied `devkit/` content to `LRPT/` sovereign tree directory.
- Updated Governance: synced `DEV_LOGS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and `TASK_MAP.md`.

## Result
- environment_state: GREEN (restored)
- luminescence_state: ACTIVE (11 passed)
- tool_alignment_m37: ALIGNED
- lrpt_materialization_state: SEEDED
- blocking_state: NOT_BLOCKING
