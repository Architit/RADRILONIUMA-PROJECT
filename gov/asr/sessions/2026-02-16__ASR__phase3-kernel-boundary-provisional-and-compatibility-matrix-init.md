asr_id: phase3-kernel-boundary-provisional-and-compatibility-matrix-init
scope: global research plan phase-3 concretization
mode: contracts-first governance planning

## Task
- Concretize kernel vNext boundary from available evidence.
- Initialize compatibility matrix for break/non-break governance decisions.

## Actions
- updated `KERNEL_BOUNDARY_CONTRACT.md` from `DRAFT` to `PROVISIONAL`
- set kernel target to `RADRILONIUMA-PROJECT@main` with explicit evidence-backed confidence state
- created `COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX.md` with change classes and release gate checklist

## Result
- phase3_kernel_boundary_state: PROVISIONAL_SET
- compatibility_matrix_state: INITIALIZED
- unresolved_inputs: compatibility window policy, downstream criteria, final tag policy
