asr_id: phase5-unblock-wave-w5-kernel-boundary-promotion-release-ready-provisional
scope: kernel-boundary promotion axis for release-gate unblock wave
mode: unblock-wave execution

## Task
- Execute w5 kernel-boundary promotion decision based on current evidence.

## Actions
- created `PHASE5_KERNEL_BOUNDARY_PROMOTION_DECISION_CONTRACT.md`
- updated `KERNEL_BOUNDARY_CONTRACT.md` to `RELEASE_READY_PROVISIONAL`
- updated `PHASE5_RELEASE_GATE_UNBLOCK_EVIDENCE_MAP.md` (`w5: DONE`)

## Result
- kernel_boundary_promotion_state: RELEASE_READY_PROVISIONAL
- phase5_unblock_wave_w5_state: DONE
- phase5_unblock_wave_next_step: w6_release_gate_redecision
