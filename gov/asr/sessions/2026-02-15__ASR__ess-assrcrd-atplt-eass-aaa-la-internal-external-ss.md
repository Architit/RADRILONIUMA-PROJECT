timestamp_utc: 2026-02-15T23:54:20Z
scope: governance record for report/fact-check integration and SS sync declaration
source_of_truth: RADRILONIUMA-PROJECT
protocol_version: v1.0.0
signal: "1+2+3+ ESS ASSRCRD ATPLT EASS A A A L A to ntrnl nd xtrnl ss"

## Objective
- Execute combined operation:
  - report-ready artifact,
  - fact-check split artifact,
  - governance integration.
- Register ESS/ASR checkpoint in ATPLT/EASS AAA-level semantics.
- Declare synchronized session-state pointers for internal and external SS tracks.

## Artifacts Produced
- `ARCHAIAEDEMANAGEL_ARCHITECTURE_REPORT.md`
- `ARCHAIAEDEMANAGEL_FACT_CHECK_SPLIT.md`

## Governance Integration Targets
- `gov/asr/INDEX.md`
- `DEV_LOGS.md`
- `ROADMAP.md`
- `GOV_STATUS.md`
- `WORKFLOW_SNAPSHOT_STATE.md`

## Session-State Sync Declaration
- internal_ss_state: SYNCHRONIZED
- external_ss_state: SYNCHRONIZED
- sync_mode: ATPLT_EASS_AAA_LA

## Result
- ess_record_state: RECORDED
- assrcrd_state: RECORDED
- governance_integration_state: COMPLETE
- report_state: COMPLETE
- fact_check_split_state: COMPLETE
