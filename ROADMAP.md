# RADRILONIUMA DevKit Roadmap

This repository is the central DevKit for the RADRILONIUMA ecosystem.

Governance focus:
- The DevKit is mandatory for all ecosystem development and integration work.
- The canonical patcher is `devkit/patch.sh`.
- Tooling and processes must comply with these mandates.
- Changes to this governance require explicit review and consensus.
