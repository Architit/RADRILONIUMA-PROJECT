# WORKFLOW_SNAPSHOT.md (DEPRECATED)

This file is **deprecated** and MUST NOT be used as the canonical workflow snapshot.

Canonical split architecture:
- `WORKFLOW_SNAPSHOT_CONTRACT.md` — contract (rules / required fields)
- `WORKFLOW_SNAPSHOT_STATE.md` — state (single source of truth)

Reason:
- Phase 4.C introduced a split contract/state architecture to prevent ambiguity and reduce coupling.
