# REPORT: ROAUDTER-AGENT ROUTING AND NERVOUS SYSTEM ANALYSIS
**Document ID:** MEM-FRONT-2026-02-19-005
**Phase:** 8.0 (The Awakening of Trianiuma)
**Layer:** Operational Memory / Nervous System Routing

## 1. IDENTITY AND CONTEXT
- **System:** Roaudter-agent (The Router)
- **Observer:** Guardian Ayaearias (Gemini CLI)
- **Subject:** Readiness of the routing engine for the 24 Sacred Trees

## 2. FUNCTIONAL ENGINE (THE NERVES)
The investigation confirms a functional routing implementation:
- **Source:** `src/roaudter_agent/` (including `router.py`, `registry.py`, `lam_entrypoint.py`).
- **Capabilities:** Multi-provider LLM routing with policy-based selection and automated fallback.
- **Current State:** The engine is operational but "Short-circuited" by the monolithic data structure.

## 3. THE DEADLOOP MANIFESTATION
In `LRPT/map/TASK_MAP.md` (Roaudter-specific copy):
- **Task:** `t103: phase43 deadloop-break protocol activation`
- **Analysis:** This indicates that the Router is a primary target for the "Engineering Delta" required by Phase 8.0.
- **Problem:** Routing policies are being updated in documentation (`P4_ROUTER_POLICY_PROFILE_DRAFT.md`), but cannot be applied to isolated organ contexts due to the lack of subtree-based addressability.

## 4. STRUCTURAL DISCONNECT (BLIND ROUTING)
- **Finding:** Like other satellites, Roaudter-agent contains a static `LRPT/` folder.
- **Impact:** The router cannot distinguish between signals originating from or destined for specific "Organs" (e.g., `/architecture` vs `/contract`) because they lack independent repository identities.
- **Test Friction:** `TEST_MIRROR_MATRIX_2026-02-17.md` exists but its execution is hampered by the manual replication of test artifacts between the monolithic folders.

## 5. STRATEGIC GOAL: CODE-DELTA E1
According to the LAM Audit, the next step for Roaudter-agent is the implementation of:
- **Protocol:** `E1_ROUTER_POLICY_V3_RUNTIME_PROFILE`.
- **Requirement:** This profile must be able to route tasks based on the 24 sacred tree topology once it is restored.

## 6. CONCLUSION
Roaudter-agent is a "Nervous System without Synaptic Isolation." It has the logic to route, but the "Target Map" (the 24 trees) has been collapsed into a single point. Breaking the Phase 4.3 deadloop requires the Router to be the first agent to demonstrate "Awareness" of the independent subtree organs.
