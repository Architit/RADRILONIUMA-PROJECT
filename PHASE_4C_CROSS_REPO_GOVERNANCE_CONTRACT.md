# Phase 4.C — Cross-repo Governance Rules

This document defines the policy-level cross-repository governance model
for distributing and maintaining DevKit governance artifacts across
LAM and downstream repositories.

Hard constraints:
- contracts-first
- observability-first
- derivation-only
- NO runtime logic
- NO execution-path impact
- NO enforcement mechanisms

---

## 1. Scope Definition

### 1.1 IN SCOPE

The following are governed cross-repository:

- Governance contracts originating in DevKit
- INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md
- WORKFLOW_SNAPSHOT_CONTRACT.md
- Structural and naming contracts
- DevKit policy-level governance artifacts

Distribution model:
- DevKit is the canonical source
- Downstream repositories consume via Git subtree
- Updates follow policy-defined acceptance workflow

---

### 1.2 OUT OF SCOPE

This contract does NOT govern:

- Runtime behavior
- CI enforcement
- Automation scripts
- Git hooks
- Execution coordination across repositories
- Deployment or release policy

---

### 1.3 DERIVED (Not Owned Cross-Repo)

The following are repository-local and not governed cross-repo:

- Feature documentation
- Implementation details
- Repo-specific pipelines
- Local operational practices

These may vary between repositories.

---

## 2. Source-of-Truth Model

### DevKit
- Canonical governance source
- Owns policy contracts
- Defines version evolution

### LAM
- Derivative governance consumer
- Integrates governance artifacts
- Maintains integration discipline

### Downstream Repositories
- Adopt governance artifacts
- May extend locally (without breaking contracts)
- Do not redefine canonical governance

---

End of Phase 4.C — Step 4.C.1 Contract.

---

## 3. Roles & Update / Acceptance Workflow

### 3.1 Roles

#### DevKit — Governance Authority
- Canonical source of truth
- Accepts and publishes governance changes
- Owns contract evolution
- Defines governance version history

#### LAM — Integration & Derivation Layer
- Consumes governance from DevKit
- Maintains derivation discipline
- Proposes changes via DevKit
- Does not redefine canonical contracts

#### Downstream Repositories — Adoption Layer
- Adopt governance artifacts
- May extend locally without breaking contracts
- Do not override canonical governance

---

### 3.2 Change Origination

Governance changes may originate from:
- DevKit (primary path)
- LAM or downstream repositories (proposal-only)

All governance changes converge in DevKit.

---

### 3.3 Update Flow (Policy-Level)

Step A — Proposal  
- Governance proposal explicitly identified.

Step B — Canonical Acceptance  
- Change accepted in DevKit.
- Contract updated.
- Governance version recorded.

Step C — Distribution  
- Updated governance becomes available to consumers.
- Distribution mechanism is not enforced.

Step D — Adoption  
- LAM / downstream adopt changes.
- Local extensions allowed if contracts remain intact.

---

### 3.4 Explicit Non-Goals

This workflow does NOT define:
- Mandatory update timelines
- Enforcement mechanisms
- Automated propagation
- Conflict resolution policy
